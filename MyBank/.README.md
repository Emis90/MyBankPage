I build a React project where you can add transactions to your back account.
All input fields are validate.

You can change your credentials, all input fields are validated.

API Specification
The API is a standard REST API with endpoints that accept and receive JSON. Successful responses will have an HTTP 2xx status. Responses to requests with client-side errors will have a 4xx status. Server-side errors will result in a 500 status.

index.js contains 'faker data apis', I used miragejs library as a server since I dont have a real database or a real server for that matter.
